# Technical Writing

A few examples to show my skills in technical writing. Although, to me, technical writing is a process that is always adapting and improving based upon new information. As for right now, my papers are a bit long and contain complex signia or mathematical signs, so I will only write the title and description below it. However, I am always up to sharing my papers, although as a heads up, I am always learning new techniques so some may be good, some may not be so good. 

### X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy: Analysis of a Solid Material
**Abstract:**

Through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and chemical analysis, it is possible to detect electrons that were ejected from the atoms orbitals by being excited by an x-ray beam in a solid sample. During the procedure it was possible to see what the binding energies and the core-level energies were. By analyzing the data of the spectra of the unknown dielectric metal sample it came out to be composed of four elements: fluorine, oxygen, carbon, and titanium. As a result we were able to find the atomic concentrations for each element, with carbon being the greatest, satisfy Moseley’s law and analyze each specific spectra.

### Analyzing the Effects of Faraday Rotation
**Abstract:**

A glass medium is placed between a laser diode and a detector that measures the change in voltage as the laser oscillates and the polarized angle changes. This will show the interaction of light and a magnetic field and thus the Faraday rotation. The light source will be rotated by some final angle from the initial angle and this difference will be plotted with the magnetic field to obtain the Verdet constant, which was calculated to be 16.3 rad/mT.

### Frank-Hertz: Excitation Potentials
**Abstract:**

Using a Klinger tube to measure excitation potentials; this experiment will duplicate the Frank-Hertz experiment. The effects of the current rising and then dropping will be observed as the electrons will reach the excitation potential of the mercury vapor. We will be plotting a graph of the accelerating voltage and the anode current. This will support the Bohr’s theory of the atom and show that electrons carry quantum energy and can transfer it to other particles.

### Microwave Diffraction
**Abstract:**

Using different approaches to understand wave behavior. A source will emit microwaves to a receiver and three methods will be used that will measure reflected waves, grazing angles, wavelengths, and angles of polarization: Standing Waves, Brewster’s Angle, and Bragg Diffraction. Plotting and calculating will be implemented in this experiment throughout each method. For the standing wave experiment the wavelength became 114 mm, the Brewster’s Angle came out to be 310.3 degrees and in the Bragg Diffraction experiment the calculated spacing between two beads was 6.65 cm.

### Lasers and Electron Transition Emissions
**Abstract:**

Measuring electron energy transitions within an atom through diffraction and the use of lasers and emission tubes. Three lasers, separately, will hit a screen and produce an incident angle and a reflected angle: red (647.1 nm), green (532 nm), and blue (405 nm). Measuring geometrically the different lengths along to get the reflected angle   the spacing of the slits can be found. The grazing angle is then calculated for each laser: blue (15.1 degrees), green (19.7 degrees), and red (38.6 degrees). Next we look at emission tubes: hydrogen and an unknown element A. Expanding and using the same processes we look at their spectral lines, find the grazing wavelengths, and then identify the element A, which was found out to be cadmium.
