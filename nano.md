# Welcome to my Nanoscience Research Page

My experiments with Janus particles included the use of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and EDS (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy). Using the beam of electrons to bounce off the surface of the particles helped us create images shown below. Knowing how the particles were structured was key to understanding their observational behavior. Along with the images, we used EDS to make sure the compounds of the particles were the desired result (since there could be contaminates).

During my time as a graduate student, I continued my research with Janus particles but this time in another direction. I was tasked in gathering data (videos, SEM, velocities, etc.) of different types of particles that defer in elemental composition or geometry make-up. I used a microscope in order to see them and used a camera to record their movements (propulsion) so I could see how much one would change from another. Using SEM was a way to look at them more closely since they were incredibly small (~nanometer). Some required UV light in order to activate propulsion. This type of research was used to publish a paper, but right now, I cannot disclose that yet.

Research summary introduction:

The speeds of these self-propelling Janus particles are important to obtain to enable a comparison between different element compositions or particle geometry. These comparisons will determine the best propulsion system for optimal delivery. If these Janus particles are to be used for living organisms, they need to be not harmful to said organism. Not to mention knowing what the average speeds of these particles can scientifically predict if they can maneuver through a living body. Blood is being pumped with their own set of velocities, have their own viscosity, and the particles could be transported throughout the entire body. Or if these Janus particles are to be used for environmental use, they most likely need to be composed of elements that will not get absorbed into their surroundings or be sensitive to the UV exposure. Nonetheless, the need to control their direction(s) is a desired outcome.
UV light can turn the Janus particle’s motion on or off readily. Where they go is a little difficult to control since these Janus particles move randomly, called Brownian Motion. With the given equipment, the only way to semi-control the outcome is to change the geometric shape of the particle. The tail extended from the bead could influence which behavior these particles exhibit.

Elements I used (combinations): Silicon, Oxygen, Titanium, Gold.

Title: Shape-Dependent Motion Of Structured Photoactive Microswimmers

Abstract:
We investigate the dynamics of structured photoactive microswimmers and show that morphology sensitively determines the swimming behavior. Particular to this study, a major portion of the light-activated particles’ underlying structure is built from a photocatalytic material, made possible by dynamic physical vapor deposition (DPVD). We find that swimmers of this type exhibit unique shape-dependent autonomous swimming that is distinct from what is seem in systems with similar structural morphology but not fabricated directly from the catalyst. Notably, the direction of motion is a function of these parameters. Because the swimming behavior is strongly correlated with particle shape and material composition, DPVD allows for engineering small-scale propulsion by adjusting the fabrication parameters to match the desired performance.
