# Welcome to my Nanoscience Research Page

My experiments with Janus particles included the use of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and EDS (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy). Using the beam of electrons to bounce off the surface of the particles helped us create images shown below. Knowing how the particles were structured was key to understanding their observational behavior. Along with the images, we used EDS to make sure the compounds of the particles were the desired result (since there could be contaminates).

Title: Shape-Dependent Motion Of Structured Photoactive Microswimmers

Abstract:
We investigate the dynamics of structured photoactive microswimmers and show that morphology sensitively determines the swimming behavior. Particular to this study, a major portion of the light-activated particlesâ€™ underlying structure is built from a photocatalytic material, made possible by dynamic physical vapor deposition (DPVD). We find that swimmers of this type exhibit unique shape-dependent autonomous swimming that is distinct from what is seem in systems with similar structural morphology but not fabricated directly from the catalyst. Notably, the direction of motion is a function of these parameters. Because the swimming behavior is strongly correlated with particle shape and material composition, DPVD allows for engineering small-scale propulsion by adjusting the fabrication parameters to match the desired performance.
