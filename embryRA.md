## NITARP/NASA/ERAU

This research project was through Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, but it was funded by NASA/NITARP. It was the study of data provided by the Kepler Satellite and the purpose was to find the difference or determine a star's age and type by looking at light-curves, temperatures, sinusoidal graphs, and star periods. I worked along side with two other peers, a few professors, and two NASA employees. The results were then published as a paper and poster at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference in 2012. It was a short program, but it was fun learning about stars and finding out through our research that older stars have rotational patterns and younger stars had pulsation patterns. Although we didn't get the credit, our research resulted in the founding of a new exoplanet. More is detailed here: [Astronomy](./astro.md).
