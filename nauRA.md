# Research Assistant 
## _Northern Arizona University (NAU)_

My research at NAU solely focused on Nanoscience, and the goal was to be able to control the propulsion of Janus particles, which are microparticles, through various means. This type of research would greatly enhance forward thinking into practical uses such as a drug delivery system within the body. I first worked as an undergraduate under my mentor, Dr. Gibbs, at NAU in his lab before I was pulled in as a graduate. I worked on the project for roughly four years and during my senior year I was awarded the Hooper Undergraduate Research Award for my research into nanoscience. At the end of the year, I got to publish my work as a poster for the Undergraduate Symposium. It wasn't until later that some of my work was included in the published paper Shape-Dependent Motion of Structured Photoactive Microswimmers. It was written by the post-doc, at the time, and Dr. Gibbs, but I'm glad that my work got to be involved in this amazing research.

I learned greatly as a research assistant, such as learning to write technical papers, how to read scientific papers, how to read/work with raw data, and how to collaborate with peers. It was hard and tedious work, and I especially had to work over time to understand the science behind the experiments that included electromagnetism, spectroscopy, fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and so much more.
