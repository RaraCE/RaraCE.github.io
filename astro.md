# Welcome to My Astronomy Research Page

Below is a summary of the research I conducted through the Hooper Undergraduate Research Award at NAU that I presented at the Undergraduate Symposium.

Abstract:
Self-assembly of micro- and nano-particles is a rapidly expanding field which spans several disciplines including medicine, biology, engineering, and physics. New techniques to enhance self-assembly is likely to advance the field, and to lead to new materials and applications. In this project, both chemical propulsion as well as magnetism will be used to achieve just this. The self-propulsion of the particles will increase the probability of particle-particle aggregation, and the particles will be magnetized to increase the favor of attachment. The chemical/magnetic combination will be achieved by vapor deposition. The aggregation of particles will be studied by video microscopy as well as electron microscopy. The experiments will consist of systematically altering the parameters of the experiments including fuel concentration and magnetic field strengths. The data analysis will consist of analyzing the dynamics of the clustering particles.
