# Welcome to My Astronomy Research Page

My team and I were able to look at data collected from the Kepler satellite to determine characteristics of certain stars. Our findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society in 2012.

## Stellar Variability Survey of Kepler Mission Data
**Abstract:**
We propose to study Kepler Mission data releases in survey form to determine the variability and nature of stars within the mission field. Within the time frame allotted for this project, we intend to individually study light curves, frequency domain and phase plots of 200 stars to better categorize the nature of their potential variability. Our research will focus on a random sample of 200 Main Sequence dwarf stars (class V luminosity), which are most like our Sun. Kepler data will be integral to our research as the variances we are interested in studying (1-10 milli-magnitude) are not observable using ground-based telescopes. We intend to determine which of the stars sampled are periodic and to characterize their periodicity. Determining the periodicity of such stars will provide a basis for later comparison against light curves identified as potential planetary transits. We anticipate identifying stars that have no periodicity, are eclipsing binaries, pulsators, have star spots, or transiting planets. We will aim to characterize each of the stars sampled.
