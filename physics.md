# The World of Physics

Here are some of the classes I took with a short description of each. 

### Methods of Analytical Physics
Developed a deeper understanding of complex numbers, linear algebra, vector analysis, probabilities, & special functions

### Advanced Lab
Learned how to read and write technical/scientific papers, and also conducted lab experiments related to physics

### Computational Physics
This is where I got to dive into programming languages, like MATLAB and LABVIEW, and worked with problems related to physics and astronomy

### Electricity and Magnetism
Developed a deep understanding of the physical interactions of electricity and magnetism, including E*fields, B*fields, electromagnetic forces, electrically charged particles, etc. This included both experimental and theoretical equations and practices.

### Thermal & Statistical Physics
Learned more about Thermodynamics, including how statistics and probabilities play a part in it

### Solid State Physics
Was introduced to topics such as the study of rigid matter and how methods like crystallography and electromagnetism explain their interactions

### Nuclear Physics
Introduced to the basic math, theories, and experiments of nuclear energy, including plasma energy research
