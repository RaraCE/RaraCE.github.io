# Introduction 
This website is to serve as my portfolio. It lists my achievements, work or academic experiences, awards and certifications. I go into further depth through the links provided on certain subjects, like what I learned, what I liked the most, etc.

### Goals
As someone who graduated with a B.S. in Physics, it's hard to know exactly what career I want to go into. I've learned from electronics to astrophysics to nuclear physics to computer programming to chemistry to mathematics, and more. I had a taste of everything, which made it a little difficult to choose on what career I wanted to aim for, but one thing is certain, working with technology is what I want to work in. More specifically working in plasma electronics (or microelectronic device fabrication). My current job allows me to be immersed in this type of field but I have yet to go back to school to get a degree in plasma physics or something equivalent.

### About Me
I am a well-rounded person, meaning I want to know a bit about everything but I don't lose focus on the big goal. 
_"Knowledge is Key"_  _"Imagination is Important"_ and _"Wisdom Speaks to the Soul"_ are some of the things I like to live by. Knowing how to effectively communicate, to know what your weaknesses and strengths are, and to know what tools you have are important not only for work, but for life as well. 

Being able to explore is important to me since I find inspiration from it, which drives me to think bolder, wider, and encourages me to think outside-of-the box. When I'm immersed in something my mind quickly makes out the flaws then works on improving it for future use. I don't see things as 'wrong' since there is always a way for something to be improved upon. It reminds me that even as humans we are always constantly learning new things, and hopefully adapting to it.

3. **Mathematics** (Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, Langrangian, Quantum (basic))
4. **Electronics** (circuits, breadboards, logic gates, sequential logic circuits, etc.)

# Authorship
Writing has always filled my life, but now it's more of a hobby, which turned into mutlple book projects. I self-publish all of my books through Amazon Kindle. [Click here](https://booksbyrce.blogspot.com/) to be diverted to my author's webpage in fictional fantasy and science fiction. Technical/Scientific writing can be found here: [Technical Writing](./techwr.md)


# Certifications/Awards
1. [Python](./python.md): A certification I earned through Microsoft offered at Edx.org.
2. Hooper Undergraduate Research Award (HURA): Awarded by Northern Arizona University in 2015
