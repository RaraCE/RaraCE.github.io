# Introduction 
This website is to serve as my portfolio. It lists my achievements, work or academic experiences, awards and certifications. I go into further depth on some subjects or provide useful links. If also interested, here is the link to my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ra-shae-esplin-a1a44b53/).

### Goals
To further my career using the tools I've gathered throughout life and to continue learning new tricks of the trade. 

### About Me
I am a well-rounded person, meaning I want to know a bit about everything but I don't lose focus on the main goal. 
_"Knowledge is Key"_  _"Imagination is Important"_ and _"Wisdom Speaks to the Soul"_ are some of the things I like to live by. Knowing how to effectively communicate, to know what your weaknesses and strengths are, and to know what tools you have are important not only for work, but for life as well. 

Being able to explore is important to me since I find inspiration from it, which drives me to think bolder, more imaginative, and encourages me to think outside-of-the box. When I'm immersed in something my mind quickly sets out to improve it to make it better or enjoyable.

# Research and Published Papers
One area I am proud of was the opportunity to conduct lab research. I learned many things from electromagnetism to working in a lab to recording data to knowing how to read other people's data/published papers, etc. Please click one of them to read more. Also, click here, [NAU Spotlight](http://news.nau.edu/student-spotlight-june-8-2018/#.XUeI4OhKjIV), to read a small article recognizing our work at the university!
