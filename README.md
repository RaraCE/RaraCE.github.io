# Introduction 
This website is to serve as my portfolio. It lists my achievements, work or academic experiences, awards and certifications. I go into further depth through the links provided on certain subjects, like what I learned, what I liked the most, etc.

###Goals
As someone who graduated with a B.S. in Physics, it's hard to know exactly what I want to do. I've learned from electronics to astrophysics to nuclear physics to computer programming to chemistry to mathematics, etc. I had a taste of everything, which made it a little difficult to choose on what career I wanted to aim for, but one thing is certain, working with technology is what I want to do. However, it couldn't be just anything, and although I don't have much experience in the tech industry, being a _Software Developer_ is what I want to do. It is both challenging and rewarding.

###About Me
I like to be a well-rounded person, meaning I want to know everything, but in small quantities, so I can focus my attention and remember what I had learned. "Knowledge is Key" "Imagination is Important" and "Wisdom Speaks to the Soul" are some of the things I like to live by. Knowing how to effectively communicate, and to know what your weaknesses and strengths are, and to know what tools you have are important for not only in the work place, but in personal relationships as well. As a weakness, I do have a restless soul, meaning I like to get up and move around or I get restless/bored when I have to do the same thing over and over again, but as a strength, it allowed me to explore other sides of myself and of the world. I was taught how to deal with a difficult customer, how to design a website through Github, how to construct a book, how to read a page quickly and constructively, how to manage a crime scene as a forensic scientist, how to get the most work done in the least amount of time, the inner workings of the Sun and fusion reactors, and the list goes on.
I love to learn new things and going to new places, but as of right now, I want more than anything to prove myself as a Software Developer. It is a career I choose to focus on and grow into. Being one, I plan to stay as a well-rounded person, from working in apps to working on websites to whatever project comes my way.
