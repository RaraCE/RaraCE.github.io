# LABVIEW
### A Visual-based Programming Language

This was the most interesting program I had worked with. Although, I had worked with visual programming before in electronics, this one was a lot better since there were more functions and when debugging it was nice to see how everything worked behind the scenes. My first major project with it was involving building a piano. I mostly used Boolean logic and the user could push in any of the notes to play a song. Another section of the project was to get a program to identify notes by listening to a song, which I used MATLAB for that part.

_Pictures of my program will be added later._
